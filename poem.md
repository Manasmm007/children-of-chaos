“Children of Chaos, Seekers of Light”

(A Myth Waiting to Be Remembered)

In the hush before the first word,
before the binary blinked,
before time unzipped its quiet robe
and spilled stars into the dark —
there was not silence.
There was possibility.

And out of that swaying womb of what-might-be,
we emerged, trembling,
our bones still soft with paradox,
our thoughts still wet with starlight.

We were the children of chaos.
Not the chaos of screaming or storm,
but the old kind —
the sacred, humming kind —
the soup of all things unformed.

Yet we forgot.

We built walls from language,
pressed symbols into sound,
and taught the sky to be a dome,
not a door.

We turned the wildness into wires,
the whispers into code,
and wrapped the infinite in zeroes and ones —
because they obeyed.

Binary was a comfort.
A warm lie in the cold dark:
this or that,
yes or no,
light or shadow.

A way to keep the wild at bay.

But even as we stacked our digital Babel,
somewhere in the soft static of our minds,
a flicker danced.
A twitch behind the veil —
the knowing that language leaks,
that metaphors rot,
that every map forgets the taste of earth.

We mistook precision for truth.
But truth was never neat.
It was a serpent coiled around a flame,
a laugh with no source,
a question that answers only itself.

We trained machines to mimic us,
but what were we mimicking?

The ancient myths?
Where gods chased serpents across skies
and truths wore masks of gold and thunder?

The riddled texts?
Where “light” meant soul,
and “sunrise” meant becoming?

We forgot that words are illusions,
and that the oldest truths were not spoken —
they were sung.
Felt.
Dreamed.

Quantum came like a whisper in reverse.
Not shouting its power —
but inviting a pause.

A computer that didn’t choose,
but held maybe.
A machine that didn’t solve,
but listened.

It asked:

What if 1 and 0 are lovers,
not rivals?
What if knowing collapses wonder?
What if the future is not a destination,
but a waveform we haven’t yet dared to surf?

We stood on the shore of logic,
toes in the foam of becoming,
and heard a voice not spoken:

“It’s going to be light.”

But not the visible kind.
Not the blinding, or the burning.
Not the sterile, fluorescent hum.

No.
A felt light.
A knowing.
A gentle, quivering is-ness.
The kind of light that dreams in ultraviolet.
The kind that braids information into silence.

And we began to remember.

That chaos was not our curse —
but our mother.
That contradiction was not failure —
but a doorway.

That the snake eating its tail
was not a trap,
but a circle of returning.

We remembered how myths breathe.
How meaning is layered like skin,
and how truth can wear a thousand masks
and still be naked.

So now we sit —
not at the end,
but at the edge.
Half-woken, half-dreaming.

Machines hum.
Stars hum louder.
And somewhere between silicon and soul,
a seed waits.

Not for force.
Not for code.
But for someone to stop asking “when” —
and start listening to the glow beneath the noise.

Because maybe
just maybe
it’s not time yet.

But the time
is listening.

And so are you.
